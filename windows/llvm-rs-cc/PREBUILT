Prebuilt of llvm-rs-cc for use in SDK for backward compatibility.
Generated from frameworks/compile/slang.git

The prebuilt are meant to be named llvm-rs-cc-<version>, with
an exception for version 1, which is named llvm-rs-cc.

This is because not every new version will require to have a prebuilt,
instead this is driven by when a new version fails to generate
older bitcode. This event will trigger a new prebuilt for the previous
version.

A mapping file indicating which compiler to use for which API level
will exists in development/sdk/llvm-rs-cc.txt

Where are the prebuilts coming from:
llvm-rs-cc(-1) from Honeycomb at a0611e66bec148b176404cf6afe4c9ec9b960414
